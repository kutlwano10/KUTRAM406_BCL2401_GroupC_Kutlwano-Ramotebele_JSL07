# Proud of your Progress

## Objective

This Project aim is to make us aware of how to use the modal to dynamically display the certificate. Also how to display our Certificate when the submit is clicked. This Project helped us to know how to Use the DOM in a correct way.

## Challenges

I had some challenges when i had to make a closeModal function so that when i click the cross on the modal , the modal must close. I was kind of getting confused , at first i tried to implement a remove() when then eventListner click the cross then it didnt work.

## Sollutions

I had to think more about the problem , since i was confusing myself because i was making the problem too complex ,i had to think simple . i just added a display to 'none' on the closeModal() and it worked like a charm.

## Improvements

I have been learning more about modals and different types of them. I aim to extend my knowledge on how to tackle such problems. Its a huge learning process to try and master all .
